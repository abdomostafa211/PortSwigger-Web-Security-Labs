## Lab 3: User role controlled by request parameter (Apprentice)

### ðŸŽ¯ Mission Description  
This lab has an admin panel at `/admin`, which identifies admins using a forgeable cookie.

### ðŸŽ¯ Mission Objective  
Log in, escalate privileges by tampering with the cookie, then delete user `carlos`.

### ðŸ§ª Steps (My Approach)

1. Logged in as normal user:  

Username: wiener
Password: peter


2. Tried accessing `/admin`.  
â†’ Got error: "Admin interface only available if logged in as an administrator."

3. Intercepted request in Burp and noticed:  

Cookie: Admin=false


4. Changed cookie from `false` to `true`.  
â†’ Gained access to `/admin`.

5. Deleted user `carlos`.  
â†’ Success.

### âœ… Final Step  
Tampered cookie:  

Admin=true

### ðŸ§  Notes  
- Insecure role-based access control.  
- Roles must be enforced server-side, not client-side.  
- Cookie tampering is a common access control bypass.

### âœ… Status: Solved ðŸŽ‰
